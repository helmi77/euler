/*
 * This program takes an integer as input and calculates
 * the first triangle number which has a divisor count
 * that is larger than the specified input.
 *
 * The n-th triangle number is defined as the sum of
 * all integers up to and including n.
 * e.g. 4-th triangle number: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
 *
 * The divisors of n are defined as the integers up to
 * and including n, whichevenly divide n.
 * e.g. divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6
